# kuribot-chatgpt-general-discord-bot
Discord bot whose main function is to act as an anime catgirl chatbot or base chatgpt, but also does a lot of other miscellaneous things that a fun discord bot should such as gives random anime quotes, 8ball answers to a question etc.

1. set up a discord bot on their creator service
2. give the bot permissions to at least read messages, write messages, join a voice channel and play voice
3. invite the bot to your discord server
4. install requirements.txt
5. paste your discord bots token into the TOKEN varible in kuribot.py
6. paste your openai token into the token varible in gpthistory.py
7. run from the command line using: python main.py

you can customize kuris personality by editing the first line of the template variable in gpthistory.py (this acts as a pre-promt to get the desired personality out of base chatgpt)
